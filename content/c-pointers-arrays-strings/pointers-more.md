## Learning Outcomes

* Distinguish between a memory address and a value in memory.
* Get familiar with the paradigm of byte-addressable memory, i.e., that each byte in memory has an address, and each address refers to a byte location in memory.

## Memory Is Like a Byte-Addressable Array

### Address vs. Value


## This Chapter

In this chapter, we will cover three very closely-related concepts that get us closer to understanding how memory works under the hood: **pointers**, **arrays**, and **C strings**. Each of these concepts come with their own benefits and pitfalls. Let's dive in!
