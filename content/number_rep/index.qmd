## Precheck Questions
1. **True/False**: Depending on the context, the same sequence of bits may represent different things.    

::: {.callout-note title="Answer" collapse="true"}
**True.** The same bits can be interpreted in many different ways with the exact same bits! The bits
can represent anything from an unsigned number to a signed number or even, as we will cover
later, a program. It is all dependent on its agreed upon interpretation.
:::

2. **True/False**: If you interpret a $N$-bit Two's complement number as an unsigned number, negative numbers would be smaller than 
positive numbers.

::: {.callout-note title="Answer" collapse="true"}
**False.** In Two’s Complement, the MSB is always 1 for a negative number. This means EVERY
negative number in Two’s Complement, when converted to unsigned, will be larger than the
positive numbers.
:::

3. **True/False**: We can represent fractions and decimals in our given number representation formats (unsigned, biased, and Two’s Complement).

::: {.callout-note title="Answer" collapse="true"}
**False.** Our current representation formats has a major limitation; we can only represent and do
arithmetic with integers. To successfully represent fractional values as well as numbers with
extremely high magnitude beyond our current boundaries, we need another representation
format.
:::

4. How many numbers can be represented by an unsigned, base-4, $n$-digit number.    
    **A.** 1    
    **B.** $2^n - 1$    
    **C.** $4^n$    
    **D.** $4^{n-1}$    
    **E.** $4^n - 1$

::: {.callout-note title="Answer" collapse="true"}
**C.**
:::

5. How many bits are needed to represent decimal number 116 in binary?

::: {.callout-note title="Answer" collapse="true"}
**7 bits**. $(116)_{10} =$ `0b111 0100` or $log{_2}{116} \approx 6.85$ which we round to 7 bits.
