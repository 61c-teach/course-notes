## Precheck
If we have an $n$-digit unsigned numeral $d_{n-1}$ $d_{n-2}$...$d_0$ in radix (or base) $r$, then the value of that numeral is:
$$
\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} r^i d_i
$$
which is just fancy notation to say that instead of a 10's or 100's place we have an $r$'s or $r^2$'s place. For the three radices binary, decimal, and hex, we just let $r$ be 2, 10, and 16, respectively.
