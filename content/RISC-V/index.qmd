### What is RISC-V
RISC-V is an assembly language composed of simple instructions that each perform a single task
such as addition of two numbers or storing data to memory. Below is a comparison between RISCV code and its equivalent C code:


::: {layout-ncol=2}

<div>
**C**
```c
int x = 5;
y[0] = x;
y[1] = x * x;
```
</div>

<div> 
**RISC-V**
```mips
addi s0, x0, 5
sw   s0, 0(s1)
mul  t0, s0, s0
sw   t0, 4(s1)
```
</div>


Man this side by side took took too long
