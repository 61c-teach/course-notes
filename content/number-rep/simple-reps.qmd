## Sign-Magnitude: [Ain’t No Free Lunch](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_such_thing_as_a_free_lunch) (tell story)


* Strawman (“obvious”) solution:
  * Leftmost **sign bit**: 0 → +, 1 → –
  * Rest of bits: numerical value
* Sign-magnitude is rarely used, due to many shortcomings:
  * Incrementing “binary odometer” increases then decreases values 
  * Arithmetic circuit complicated: depends on signs same/different
  * Two zeros (how to compare??)
* Reasonable for signal processing,
not for general purpose computers

Curved lines map the hexadecimal digits to a binary expansion, illustrating that the leading bit determines the sign while the remaining bits represent the magnitude of zero."}

## Ones' Complement: Another Try

* To represent a negative number, complement ("**flip**") the bits of its positive representation:

Curved orange arrows indicate that each bit in the binary sequence `0000 0111` is inverted to produce the resulting sequence `1111 1000`."}

Two gold arrows point to the right to indicate that both positive and negative binary sequences increase in value as the odometer increments from left to right."}

* Observations:
  * Positive numbers: leading 0s
  * Negative numbers: leading 1s
* #s represented in N bits:
  * Zero: 2
  * Positive: $2^{N-1} - 1$
  * Negative: (same as positive)

## Shortcomings of Ones' Complement?

* Advantages:
  * Leftmost bit (“most significant bit”) is still effectively sign bit
  * Incrementing binary odometer consistent on the # line

* Some disadvantages still persist:
  * Still two zeros
  * Arithmetic still somewhat complicated (more later)
* While used for a while on some computer products
  * It’s not currently used in current hardware
