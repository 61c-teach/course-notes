## Data input: Analog $\rightarrow$ Digital

* Real world is analog!
* To import analog information, we must do two things
  * Sample
    * E.g., for a CD, every 44,100ths of a second, we ask a music signal how loud it is.
  * Quantize
    * For every one of these samples, we figure out where, on a 16-bit (65,536 tic-mark) “yardstick”, it lies.

<!-- add qualifier about possible digital procedure, but not the entire picture (or rather, what we do in practice) First, a signal is discretized in time with sampling. Then, it is quantized in amplitude. Finally, these datapoints become a digital representation of a signal. -->

The diagrams illustrate how continuous signals are sampled at specific intervals and mapped to discrete values to create a final digital data set."}
