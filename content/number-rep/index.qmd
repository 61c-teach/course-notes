## Data input: Analog $\rightarrow$ Digital

* Real world is analog!
* To import analog information, we must do two things
  * Sample
    * E.g., for a CD, every 44,100ths of a second, we ask a music signal how loud it is.
  * Quantize
    * For every one of these samples, we figure out where, on a 16-bit (65,536 tic-mark) “yardstick”, it lies.

<!-- add qualifier about possible digital procedure, but not the entire picture (or rather, what we do in practice) First, a signal is discretized in time with sampling. Then, it is quantized in amplitude. Finally, these datapoints become a digital representation of a signal. -->

The diagrams illustrate how continuous signals are sampled at specific intervals and mapped to discrete values to create a final digital data set."}

<!-- this is not the entire picture—must start smaller. we start with a number. -->


## BIG IDEA: Bits can represent anything!!

* Logical values? 1 bit
  * One possible convention: 0 → False, 1 → True
* Characters? Several options:
  * A, ..., Z: 26 letters $\rightarrow$  5 bits (26 $\leq$ 32)
  * [ASCII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII): upper/lower case + punctuation $\rightarrow$ 7 bits $\rightarrow$ round to 1 byte
  * Unicode ([www.unicode.com](http://www.unicode.com)): standard code to cover all the world’s  languages $\Rightarrow$ 8, 16, 32 bits

* Colors?
  * HTML color codes: 24 bits (3 bytes)
* Locations / addresses? Commands?
  * IPv4 (32 bit), IPv6 (64 bit), etc.

With N bits, you can represent at most $2^N$ things.
