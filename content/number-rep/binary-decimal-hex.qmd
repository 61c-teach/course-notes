## Number vs Numeral

**Numeral**

* A symbol or name that stands for a number
  * e.g., 4 , four , quatro , IV , IIII , …
* …and Digits are symbols that make numerals

**Number**

* The “idea” in our minds…there is only ONE of these
  * e.g., the concept of “4”

## Decimal: Base 10 (Ten) #s

Digits: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Example:

3271 = 327110 =  (3x103) + (2x102) + (7x101) + (1x100)

<!--
$$
\begin{align}
\texttt{3271} &= 3271_{10} \\
&=  (3x10^3) + (2x10^2) + (7x10^1) + (1x10^0)
\end{align}
$$
-->

## Base 2 (Two) #s, Binary

Digits: 0, 1 (**bi**nary digits $\rightarrow$ **b**its)

Example: Binary number “1101”

Convert to decimal:

0b1101	= 11012	= (1x23) + (1x22) + (0x21) + (1x20)
=  8         +  4        +  0         +  1
=  13

Common binary shorthand: `0b1101`

## Base 16 (Sixteen) #s, Hexadecimal

Digits: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B,  C,  D,  E,  F
                                                 10,  11,  12, 13, 14, 15
Example: Hexadecimal number “A5” 

Convert to decimal:
0xA5 		= A516 	= (10x161) + (5x160)
                              			=  160        +  5
                              			=  165

“Hex” for short. Common hex shorthand: `0xA5`

## Convert from Decimal to Binary

E.g., 13 to binary?
Start with the columns

![165 from a decimal to binary representation (TODO: animate)](images/dec-to-binary.png)

Left to right, is (column) ≤ number n? 

* If yes, put how many of that column fit in n, subtract col * that many from n, keep going. 
* If not, put 0 and keep going. (and Stop at 0)

## Convert from Decimal to Hexadecimal

![165 from a decimal to hexadecimal representation (TODO: animate)](images/dec-to-hex.png)

Left to right, is (column) ≤ number n? 

* If yes, put how many of that column fit in n, subtract col * that many from n, keep going. 
* If not, put 0 and keep going. (and Stop at 0)

## Nibbles and Bytes

* 4 Bits
  * 1 “Nibble”
  * 1 Hex Digit = 16 things
* 8 Bits
  * 1 “**Byte**”
  * 2 Hex Digits = 256 things

| `Dec` | `Hex` | `Bin` |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `00` | `0` | `0000` |
| `01` | `1` | `0001` |
| `02` | `2` | `0010` |
| `03` | `3` | `0011` |
| `04` | `4` | `0100` |
| `05` | `5` | `0101` |
| `06` | `6` | `0110` |
| `07` | `7` | `0111` |
| `08` | `8` | `1000` |
| `09` | `9` | `1001` |
| `10` | `A` | `1010` |
| `11` | `B` | `1011` |
| `12` | `C` | `1100` |
| `13` | `D` | `1101` |
| `14` | `E` | `1110` |
| `15` | `F` | `1111` |

## Convert Binary -> Hexadecimal

* Binary -> Hex? Easy!
  * **Left-pad** with 0s
  * (Group into full 4-bit values)
  * Look it up
  * `0b11110`
  * `→ 0b00011110`
  * `(→ 0b0001 1110)`
  * `→ 0x1E`

* Hex -> Binary? Easy!
  * Just look it up
  * `0x1E`
  * `→ 0b00011110` 
  * `→ 0b11110` (drop leading 0s)

## Which base do we use?

* **Decimal**: great for humans, especially when doing arithmetic
* **Hex**: if human looking at long strings of binary numbers, its much easier to convert to hex and see 4 bits/symbol
  * Terrible for arithmetic on paper
* **Binary**: what computers use
  * To a computer, numbers are always binary
  * Regardless of how number is written:
  * 32ten == 3210 == 0x20 == 1000002 == 0b100000

* To avoid confusion:
  * Decimal: 	subscript “ten”		or		prefix (none)
  * Hex:		subscript “hex”		or		prefix 0x 
  * Binary:		subscript “two”		or		prefix 0b

## Every Base is Base 10…?

How many rocks?

![Every base is base 10 ([web.archive.org](https://web.archive.org/web/20160505151914/http://cowbirdsinlove.com/43))](images/aliens.png)

## The computer knows it, too

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
	const int N = 1234;
	printf("Decimal: %d\n",N);
	printf("Hex: 	  %x\n",N);
	printf("Octal:   %o\n",N);

	printf("Literals (not supported by all compilers):\n");
	printf("0x4d2         = %d (hex)\n", 0x4d2);
	printf("0b10011010010 = %d (binary)\n", 0b10011010010);
	printf("02322         = %d (octal, prefix 0 - zero)\n", 0x4d2);
	return 0;
}
```

Output:
```
Decimal: 1234
Hex: 	   4d2
Octal:   2322
Literals (not supported by all compilers):
0x4d2     	= 1234 (hex)
0b10011010010 = 1234 (binary)
02322     	= 1234 (octal, prefix 0 - zero)
```

## BIG IDEA: Bits can represent anything!!

* Logical values? 1 bit
  * One possible convention: 0 → False, 1 → True
* Characters? Several options:
  * A, …, Z: 26 letters →  5 bits (26 ≤ 32)
  * [ASCII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII): upper/lower case + punctuation → 7 bits → round to 1 byte
  * Unicode ([www.unicode.com](http://www.unicode.com)): standard code to cover all the world’s  languages ⇒ 8, 16, 32 bits

* Colors?
  * HTML color codes: 24 bits (3 bytes)
* Locations / addresses? Commands?
  * IPv4 (32 bit), IPv6 (64 bit), etc.

With N bits, you can represent at most 2N things.
