## Bias Encoding

* We have a system
that can represent this:
* We want to represent this:
* **Bias encoding**: “Shift” the numbers so that they center on zero

* Formally:
  * Define a “bias”
  * To interpret stored binary: Read the data as an unsigned number, then **add the bias**
  * To store a data value: Subtract the bias, then store the resulting number as an unsigned number

```

## Bias Encoding

```
Number line
```

* Number = (unsigned rep) + (bias)
* With N bits, default bias is -(2N-1 - 1)
  * E.g., 4 bits, bias = -(23-1) = -(8-1) = -7
* Bias could be anything we want! (i.e., 4 bits could be #s 800-815)

## Bias Encoding: N = 4, bias = -7

Example: N = 4, bias = -7
* Consider:
  * One zero
  * How many positives?
  * How many negatives?
