## Bias Encoding

* We have a system
that can represent this:
* We want to represent this:
* **Bias encoding**: “Shift” the numbers so that they center on zero

* Formally:
  * Define a “bias”
  * To interpret stored binary: Read the data as an unsigned number, then **add the bias**
  * To store a data value: Subtract the bias, then store the resulting number as an unsigned number

A single gold arrow points to the right to indicate that the decimal values increase monotonically as the binary sequence increments from 0000 to 1111."}

* Number = (unsigned rep) + (bias)
* With N bits, default bias is $-(2^{N-1} - 1)$
  * E.g., 4 bits, bias $= -(2^3-1) = -(8-1) = -7$
* Bias could be anything we want! (i.e., 4 bits could be #s 800-815)

## Bias Encoding: N = 4, bias = -7

Example: N = 4, bias = -7

* Consider:
  * One zero
  * How many positives?
  * How many negatives?
